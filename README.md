# Text_Editor

## Description
This project was created so we can have a text editor in our page to create code snippets with or without an internet connection to be used for later use. This will also use data
presistence techniques in case one of the options isn't supported by one's browser. We made our application meet the criteria of a PWA(Progressive Web App).
